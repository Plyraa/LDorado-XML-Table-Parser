# LDorado-XML-Table-Parser
As the name indicates, this program intends to parse XML tables from LDorado Harness and push them into an Excel file.

It has a GUI and lets you to choose XML files. Make sure that all XML files are at the same directory otherwise you will create an exception.
Output will be created at the same directory with name format "XML_<%d-%m-%Y %H-%M-%S>.xlsx".

## On action:

Note: I develop this for my work needs in limited time so it's quick and dirty. Yet I still aim to improve it. Feel free to hit me up.
